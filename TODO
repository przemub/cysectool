DONE: direct cost in the pareto frontier dots
DONE: BUG: invalid value in "Max flow to the target: 0.0035"
WIP: justification of the flows (categories of easiness of exploitation) and costs
WIP: patching as a control (SQL injection for example)

08.07.2019
recovery controls (as a tool feature) (how?)
Done? WIP: iterative optimisation (for spending all the budgets)
? WIP: CVSS (CVE score system)

iterative optimisation gives the same results as noniterative??
done: selectable controls
done: initial flows from the case study
done: refactoring

Basic as default Password Policy
target impacts selectable in the tool
web user -> root - weak admin password!
write in todo about use cases - highest point of return on the pareto frontier
iterative optimisation - wait for checked math results
